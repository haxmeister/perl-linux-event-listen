  - Docs: clarify edge-triggered semantics and max_accept_per_tick interaction.
  - Add: family/is_unix/is_tcp convenience methods.
  - Errors: include host/port or path in setup error hashref.
  - Tests: add cancel idempotence and UNIX wrap-no-unlink coverage.

0.008  2026-02-22

0.007  2026-02-22
  - Fix: repair is_paused() declaration (was corrupted in generated tar).
  - Packaging: source-only tarballs (no blib/MANIFEST/MYMETA/Makefile).

0.006  2026-02-22
  - Setup: validate provided fh is a listening socket (SO_ACCEPTCONN).
  - Add: on_emfile callback for EMFILE/ENFILE accept failures.
  - Add: is_running, sockhost, sockport convenience methods.
  - Tests: add wrap-existing-fh and on_accept die coverage.

0.005  2026-02-22
  - Semantics: if max_accept_per_tick is explicitly set and edge_triggered is not,
    default to level-triggered readiness to prevent EPOLLET stalls.

0.004  2026-02-22
  - Tests: stop the loop explicitly and add alarms to prevent hangs.

0.003  2026-02-22
  - Fix: correct syntax regression in 0.002 (extra brace in watcher callback).

0.002  2026-02-22
  - Fix: cancel() is now safe when called inside on_accept.
    Prevents accept() on closed socket (EBADF) during read callback.
    Listener close is deferred until after read callback returns.

0.001  2026-02-22
  - Initial release.
